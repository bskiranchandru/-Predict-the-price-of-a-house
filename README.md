# -Predict-the-price-of-a-house
: The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price.

Method:
Correlation
Feature Exploration
Missing Values
Data Normalization
Feature Engineering
Assembling data set
Prediction

*** The challenge will be in the normalisation of the data and feature engineering, but there should be a number of reliable indicators for house price.***

Result:
  Multiple Linear Regression score was about 69%, thus there was opportunity for improvement with this model. Then, using the Keras Regression model, I achieved an accuracy of 81%. Additionally, note that the Keras Regression model's RMSE (loss function) is smaller, indicating that our forecast is closer to the real rating price.
